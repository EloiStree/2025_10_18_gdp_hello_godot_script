* [ ] **if** : See if/else/elif.
* [ ] **elif** : See if/else/elif.
* [ ] **else** : See if/else/elif.
* [ ] **for** : See for.
* [ ] **while** : See while.
* [ ] **match** : See match.
* [ ] **when** : Used by pattern guards in match statements.
* [ ] **break** : Exits the execution of the current for or while loop.
* [ ] **continue** : Immediately skips to the next iteration of the for or while loop.
* [ ] **pass** : Used where a statement is required syntactically but execution of code is undesired, e.g., in empty functions.
* [ ] **return** : Returns a value from a function.
* [ ] **class** : Defines an inner class. See Inner classes.
* [ ] **class_name** : Defines the script as a globally accessible class with the specified name. See Registering named classes.
* [ ] **extends** : Defines what class to extend with the current class.
* [ ] **is** : Tests whether a variable extends a given class, or is of a given built-in type.
* [ ] **in** : Tests whether a value is within a string, array, range, dictionary, or node. When used with for, it iterates through them instead of testing.
* [ ] **as** : Casts the value to a given type if possible.
* [ ] **self** : Refers to current class instance. See self.
* [ ] **super** : Resolves the scope of the parent method. See Inheritance.
* [ ] **signal** : Defines a signal. See Signals.
* [ ] **func** : Defines a function. See Functions.
* [ ] **static** : Defines a static function or a static member variable.
* [ ] **const** : Defines a constant. See Constants.
* [ ] **enum** : Defines an enum. See Enums.
* [ ] **var** : Defines a variable. See Variables.
* [ ] **breakpoint** : Editor helper for debugger breakpoints. Unlike breakpoints created by clicking in the gutter, `breakpoint` is stored in the script itself, making it persistent across different machines when using version control.
* [ ] **preload** : Preloads a class or variable. See Classes as resources.
* [ ] **await** : Waits for a signal or a coroutine to finish. See Awaiting signals or coroutines.
* [ ] **yield** : Previously used for coroutines. Kept as keyword for transition.
* [ ] **assert** : Asserts a condition, logs error on failure. Ignored in non-debug builds. See Assert keyword.
* [ ] **void** : Used to represent that a function does not return any value.
* [ ] **PI** : PI constant.
* [ ] **TAU** : TAU constant.
* [ ] **INF** : Infinity constant. Used for comparisons and as result of calculations.
* [ ] **NAN** : NAN (not a number) constant. Used as impossible result from calculations.
